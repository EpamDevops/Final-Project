The Most Popular hypervisors for infrastructure virlealizations are hypervisors (software or hardware schheme that provides simultaneous parallel oOS in 1 PC) 
like:
-Microsoft hyper-V
-VM-VarevSphere Hypervisor etc.
Also there are autonomus virtual Emulators- (applications) like:
-Oracle VirtualBox
Microsoft Virtual PC.
-Virtual PC VMware player etc.
But if we want to work at those platforms, we should to watch on system requirements.
CPU must support hardware virtualiation. For Intel CPU its Intel-Virtualization technology, for AMD- secure virtual machine technology.
Types of virtualizations:
Virtualization of operating systems such as VMVare,Microsoft,Oracle and virtualization of application servers, whitch included:
-Application virtualiation
-hardware virtualization
-network vitualization
-storage virtualization
One of the competitor of virtualization is container virtualization, whitch is run at the sam level as phisical servers,that can work with better performance,than virtualization because of:
-can run max applications on minimum number of servers and int used hardware withoiut virtual drivers to devices, so it take to us better performance.
